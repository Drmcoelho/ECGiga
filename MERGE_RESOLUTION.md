# Merge Conflict Resolution Summary

## Issue
PR #5 was in a 'dirty' state with merge conflicts due to unrelated histories between:
- Feature branch `copilot/fix-188bdcd0-fa22-45d1-b382-454fba641746` (files at root level)
- Main branch (files in `ECG_Curso_Megaprojeto_p16_append/` subdirectory + other content)

## Resolution Steps

1. **Merged unrelated histories**: Used `git merge main --allow-unrelated-histories` to merge the two branches
2. **Resolved file conflicts**:
   - `README.md` - Kept detailed version from PR branch for better documentation
   - `cli_app/ecgcourse/cli.py` - Kept stable version from PR branch (main version had syntax errors)
   - `requirements.txt` - Removed duplicate dependencies, kept comprehensive dependency list
   - `web_app/dash_app/app.py` - Used version from main branch's subdirectory

3. **Verified functionality**:
   - All dependencies install successfully
   - CLI commands work correctly (tested `analyze values`)
   - All tests pass (2/2)
   - Python syntax valid for all modules

## Result
The PR branch now includes:
- Original root-level structure from PR
- Complete `ECG_Curso_Megaprojeto_p16_append/` subdirectory from main
- Additional files/directories from main (`src_p11`, `src_unzipped`, etc.)
- Working, tested codebase ready for merge

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest -q

# Test CLI
python -m cli_app.ecgcourse.cli analyze values --qt 400 --rr 1000 --lead-i 5 --avf -3
```

All tests pass and commands execute successfully.
# Test push
